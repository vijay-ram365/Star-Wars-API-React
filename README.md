# Star-Wars-API-React
React project to get vehicle and starship data from star wars api

The Star Wars API - https://swapi.dev/

vehicle information from the Star Wars API with no guidance.

This React project features:

Hooks:
useState
useEffect

Fetching and error handling
PROPS
Functional Components
